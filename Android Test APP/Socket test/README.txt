ANRDOID SOCKET TEST APP
************************

This Android app on Andorid Studio allows testing with TCP connections by creating a client that lets you send text to the server.

On another hand, the "server.rb" it's a ruby script to start TCP server to accept connections on port 9090. This port can be changed. The server activity received is shown at the terminal.
